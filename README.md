  <h2> DSAI Data Science and Aritificial Intelligence Project </h2>
  <section>
    <p> Hello! We are Lin Kai, Yee Hao and Dhairya from Nanyang Technological University. Our project will be on bitcoin, inspired by the relatively new rise of blockchain technology. Is bitcoin actually an asset class worth considering? Or is it just an asset whose price is driven by tweets and memes and influencers? </p>

  <h2> Analysis of Model Building </h2>
  <section>
    <p> The 4 types of Machine Learning models that we have decided to build are as follows:
      <p>
      -Multi-Variate Linear Regression
      </p>
      <p>
      -Random Forest Regression
      </p>
      <p>
      -K Nearest Neighbors Regression
      </p>
      <p>
      -Neural Networks
    </p>
    
      Our group shall proceed to analyze each of the 4 models we have chosen to see their effectiveness in predicting the price of Bitcoin. Since all 4 models are regression models, we will primarily be comparing the Explained Variance (R^2 value) and Mean Squared Error (MSE value) of the 4 models to decide which model makes the best prediction for the price of Bitcoin. However, there are notable differences in characteristics between the 4 models, which our group will address. These differences might explain certain behavior or predictions by the models.
